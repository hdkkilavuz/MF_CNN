## Multi-fidelity Classification with CNN Model

This is the final research project of the Computational Statistics course of the Master's Degree in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. The team is composed of me and Melis YÄ±lmaz. 

## Problem Description

The main goal of the project is to find a multi-fidelity classifier to efficiently determine the regions in the atria where arrhythmias can be induced in cardiac tissue.
In this work, we were inspired by a previous study* and we propose to use a Convolutional Neural Network Model instead of Multi-fidelity Gaussian Process Classification.

## Data

Data is used from https://github.com/fsahli/AtrialMFclass.
The geometry and the results of the 1800 high-fidelity simulations are in the data folder in .npz files.
